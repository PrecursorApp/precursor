title: Permissions and access during deployment
last_updated: Jun 4, 2013

We designed our UI so that it is easy for you to upload the SSH keys we need
to securely deploy your projects to your production servers.

You enter the security information (public key and private key) for deployment
on your project's **Project Settings > SSH keys** page.
If you leave the **Hostname** field blank, the key will be used for all hosts.
